    <p>Work weeks are busy... weeknights show up fast again and again...

        want FOOD! Embrace the slow cooker and walk in the door at 5:30p, to 
        hot and fragrant Lasagna! With a little prep the night before (or 
        during your lunch break) this easy weeknight meal will become a 
        weekly favorite!</p>
